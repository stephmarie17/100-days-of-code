# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November, 4, 2019
##### jQuery & CSS

**Today's Progress:** Updated CSS and worked on using Open Weather API to create a weather dashboard.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more comfortable with jQuery and AJAX calls, but still figuring out the most efficient ways to utilize results from a third party API.

### Day 2: November 5, 2019
#### Going over JS Basics

**Today's Progress:** Making my way through Free Code Camp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification to supplement what I've been learning through my bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** So far I've completed 77/100 Basic JavaScript modules and 7/20 Basic Data Structures modules. Even though alot of this so far has been review, it's been helpful to have multiple iterations of lessons from my bootcamp to further build my JS knowledge base.

### Day 3: November, 6, 2019
#### 50% Done with Web Developer Bootcamp

**Today's Progress:** Today I did a code-along project that is part of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. After completing this project, I am now 50% done with this course!

**Thoughts:** Even though this was a code along, I still managed to do some independent coding by pausing the video at times  so that I could attempt my own solutions before seeing how the instructor solved different problems. Also it was a good way for me to notice little bugs that appear due to mistyping/misnaming functions etc. and still required me to do some of my own problem solving in case my code wasn't working as expected. I'm starting to feel a lot stronger with CSS as pretty much all of the CSS in this video I could do on my own without watching the instructor walkthrough.

### Day 4: November, 7, 2019
#### Bootcamp Homework Week

**Today's Progress:** For my in-person coding bootcamp, we are tasked with creating a portfolio featuring some of our work up to this point so I spent most of today working on the portfolio html and css, then started working on the other homework assignment due this week, the Weather App I worked on on Day 1. 

**Thoughts:** Weather App is already looking a lot better than it did earlier this week. Working on refactoring and cleaning up my code. There are still a few quirks to getting data from the Open Weather API that I'm still figuring out, but the assignment is nearly complete. Also, I've been really enjoying working on my portfolio and playing with the CSS.


### Day 5: November, 8, 2019
#### Completed this week's homework

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Weather Dashboard that I have been working on and feel happy that I got all of the functionality that I wanted to work.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm making a lot of progress with jQuery and JavaScript. Currently in my bootcamp we are learning node.JS and I feel way more confident writing functions to export to node than I expected. This challenge has really helped me focus on not just watching tutorials or reading how-tos, but to actually code every day and it's been so helpful.

### Day 6: November 9, 2019
#### Learning to work with Google Maps API

**Today's Progress:** My class was cancelled this weekend for Veteran's Day, so I met up with my study group and coded utilzing the Google Maps API and trying to incorporate some functionality to a website extracting event data from Google Calendar to populate the address on the map.

**Thoughts:** Definitely making progress on implementing API documentation to fit the needs of my applications.

### Day 7: November 10, 2019
#### FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress:** Today I made my way through some more of the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.

**Thoughts:** I have a tougher time coding abstract, generic functions for each unit than I do designing my own functions, but I learn a lot of little tips from completing the FreeCodeCamp activities.

### Day 8: November 11, 2019
#### Debugging Old Projects

**Today's Progress:** I decide this week to work on fixing a homework assignment I attempted when I first started my bootcamp that was completely non-functioning. Today I worked on analyzing the logic and redefining my variables, as well as switching from prompts to DOM manipulation to store user input.

**Thoughts:** It's really crazy how far I've come in my coding journey since starting my bootcamp 10 weeks ago. This assignment was from week 3 and I remember struggling so hard with it, and re-doing the project now was much less of a struggle.

### Day 9: November 12, 2019
#### Completed Assignment Redesign

**Today's Progress:** I completed the redesign of my homework assignment that I started yesterday and I'm really happy with the functionality.

**Thoughts:** I seriously cannot believe how much I have learned since Week 3 of my coding bootcamp vs now. It's like night and day. Successfully re-coding this assignment has given me so much confidence and motivation for where I'll be as a developer in another ten weeks.

### Day 10: November, 13, 2019
#### Learning Node.js & JavaScript callbacks

**Today's Progres:** The past few weeks I've been getting into node.js and applying my knowledge of JavaScript to build back-end applications. Today I just practiced different built-in methods to further familiarize myself with node. 

**Thoughts:** I'm getting more comfortable using differnet open source libraries and can't wait to learn even more and start working more on the back-end.

### Day 11: November, 14, 2019
#### Making Web Dev Bootcamp progress

**Today's Progress:** Today I did a code-along with Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp to create a to-do list using jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Like the other code-along project for this course, I tried to code on my own and then see how the instructor solved the different problems. I did a project similar to this in my own in-person bootcamp, and I felt way more comfortable doing this on my own this time around.

### Day 12: November 14, 2019
#### More JavaScript & Node.js

**Today's Progress:** I worked on more FreeCodeCamp but then it crashed for some reason. I'm almost done with the JavaScript Basics and Data Structures section. I'm also really proud that I've made it 60% through Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp! I kept working on exporting functions to Node.js and learning cloud developer environments.

**Thoughts:** The full-stack workflow is making a lot more sense to me now, and I honestly cannot wait to learn more back-end development! 

### Day 13: November 15, 2019
#### Practicing with Node.Js

**Today's Progress:** Today I explored more with node and setting up cloud developer environments. I worked on using node to start servers and writing files to them.

**Thoughts:** Cloud developer environments are super cool but I still feel more comfortable using the terminal on my local machine. An exciting milestone is I'm 60% done with the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy!

### Day 14: November, 16, 2019
#### Asynchronous JS & ES6

**Today's Progress:** Today I practiced re-writing functions I previously coded so that they are in ES6 format and experimented with different types of asynchronous functions in an attempt to fix a bug I'm having with a client project and asynchronous calls using a third-party API.

**Thoughts:** It was cool to study all of these different approaches to callbacks and gain a better understanding of http requests.

### Day 15: November, 17, 2019
#### More play with node.js

**Today's Progress:** I worked on an activity from my in-person coding bootcamp that we didn't get to in class, which was to use node.js to create an html file generated with information from user prompts. 

**Thoughts:** This project actually really helped me feel more comfortable with node and gain a better understanding of how I should approach a similar project I'm working on for a homework assignment.

### Day 16: November, 18, 2019
#### More node.js, big surprise

**Today's Progress:** Today I played with selecting some different packages on npm, reading through their documentation, and implementing them on node.js. 

**Thoughts:** Really excited to dive into Express so that all of the work I've been doing with node will be more functional for real applications.


### Day 17: November, 19, 2019
#### Weird JavaScript stuff

**Today's Progress:** While doing Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp, I've also been doing a purely JavaScript course on Udemy and have finally gotten to the more complex JavaScript stuff like closures and asynchronous functions. Spent today working through different coding activities to apply what I've learned.

**Thoughts:** The more I practice with JavaScript, the more I love it! There's so many cool things to do with it, I really want to deepen my JS knowledge base.

### Day 18: November, 20, 2019
#### More JS, more Node

**Today's Progress:** Continuing form yesterday, I've been working my way through Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript Course and I'm almost halfway done! Today I ran my code in node instead of the browser so I can also get node practice in, too.

**Thoughts:** Still loving learning more about JS. Bind, call, apply are super badass and I think I'm addicted to learning more about JS.

### Day 19: November, 21, 2019
#### Create node apps

**Today's Progress:** Been working on a mini-project for my in-person bootcamp, which is rendering a pdf file of a developer's profile based on their GitHub profile. Built a lot of the functionality today and researched different npm libraries to convert html files to pdf.

**Thoughts:** This project has been challenging simply because I'm getting to know the GitHub API better, but it's really fun.

### Day 20: November, 22, 2019
#### Node project continued

**Today's Progress:** Added on to what I worked on yesterday and still having a few buggy issues but feeling better about where the project will go from here.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I leave for a week long vacation so I'm a little worried about my 100 Days of Code progress but I'm so stoked I've done 20 days so far! It's gone by super fast!

### Day 21: November, 23, 2019
#### Constructors & Classes

**Today's Progress:** Today I practiced with creating Classes and coding small apps that rely on multiple classes to run.

**Thoughts:** I've been really excited to progress with JavaScript!

### Day 22: November, 25, 2019
#### Vacation Coding

**Today's Progress:** Had to skip yesterday because I was on a flight most of the day then tried to catch up on sleep once I finally made it to my vacation spot. So I will add an extra day to the end of my 100 Days of Code. Today, I finished up an activity from my bootcamp class focused on constructors and classes like on Day 21.

**Thoughts:** It may be a struggle to maintian my 100 Days of Code during my week-long island vacation, but I'm committed to it! While everyone else in my group takes their post-beach nap during the afternoon, I'll be coding.

### Day 23: November, 26, 2019
#### Vacation Coding Cont'd

**Today's Progres:** Continued learning Express and running apps in node.js.

**Thoughts:** This is really sad but I wish I was done with my vacation already so I can get home and have more time to code! I got some really good Udemy courses during the Black Friday sale and I want to start them really badly.

### Day 24: November, 27, 2019
#### Back to Node.js App

**Today's Progress:** Spent a little more time working on coding classes for a mini-project for my in-person coding bootcamp. Still teaching myself about classes and constructors.

**Thoughts:** Having fun with this project and stoked to be getting more in-depth with JavaScript.

### Day 25: November, 29, 2019
#### Javascript practice

**Today's Progress:** While doing the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy I've also been doing the Complete JavaScript Course and am just starting the project sections. Today I worked on creating the file structure and pseudo coding modules for a budget app.

**Thoughts:** This week has been tough to keep up with daily coding because Thanksgiving, unreliable resort WiFi, and now I'm starting to get sick. I fly home tomorrow and know I can't code this weekend so I'm just gonna add an extra 7 days to the end of the challenge to make up for the missed days.

### Day 26: December, 2, 2019
#### Back to coding!

**Today's Progress:** Worked more on the project I started Friday, and also did some practice with building Node servers without Express but just with Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Got super sick at the end of my vacation and yesterday literally spent the whole day asleep on my couch feeling miserable so no coding happened. Getting back into it today felt great! When I go too long without coding, I feel like something is missing from my day. Excited to get back to it.

### Day 27: December, 3, 2019
#### Fixing issues

**Today's Progress:** Worked on resolving some issues in past JavaScript projects.

**Thoughts:** There's always more to learn!

### Day 28: December, 4, 2019
#### Node.js is magic

**Today's Progress:** Spent most of today working on a project for bootcamp that dynamically generates an html page based on user input via node.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling way more comfortable with node packages now that I've worked on a few projects. Can't wait to learn more back-end!

### Day 29: December, 5, 2019
#### Continued node practice

**Today's Progress:** Worked remotely because I was sick and collaborated with a group on an express project.

**Thoguhts:** Interesting to get a taste of remote coding today! 

### Day 30: December, 6, 2019
#### Collab projects

**Today's Progress:**
**Today's Progress:** Kept working on the project from yesterday along with some tutorial coding with a few of my Udemy courses. Finished my project successfully!

**Thoughts:** It's crazy that projects that would have seemed incredibly daunting weeks ago are now so much more feasible for me to problem solve!

### Day 31: December, 7, 2019
#### Starting with SQL

**Today's Progress:** Today I started learning (or actually, re-learning, it's been awhile) SQL by creating and updating some simple databases.

**Thoughts:** I learned the theory of SQL and practiced it a little bit when I was in grad school studying library and information science. It's kinda fun to get back to it.

### Day 32: December, 8, 2019
#### More SQL Practice

**Today's Progress:** Basically just reiterating what I learned yesterday, otherwise I'll never remember it!

**Thoughts:** Very excited to learn how to incorporate databases into applications.

### Day 33: December, 9, 2019
#### Back-end Projects

**Today's Progress:** This week's bootcamp project was to build the back-end for an app that the front-end was basically complete. I spent today writing routes and starting to code the API.

**Thoughts:** Back-end is actually really fun and I could see myself wanting to pursue this full-time.

### Day 34: December, 10, 2019
#### Databases

**Today's Progress:** Kept working on my project from yesterday, and also practice more with SQL, including collaborating on a SQL application that also used node.js.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying tying databases into node projects!

### Day 35: December, 11, 2019
#### Deployed to Heroku for the first time!

**Today's Progress:** Finished writing the back-end for my project and successfully deployed to Heroku for the first time!

**Thoughts:** The terminal is magic.

### Day 36: December, 12, 2019
#### JS practice and mySQL

**Today's Progress:** Today I made progress working on a budget app built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also practiced some more with created and updating data with mySQL in node.js.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how I feel about SQL in general at this point. I learned it originally in grad school, but it's been awhile and I just really like designing interfaces so I don't know if it's for me exactly.

### Day 37: Deember, 13, 2019
#### More JS progress

**Today's Progress:** Made some good progress on the budget app project. This is a project I'm completing as part of the Complete JavaScript Course 2020 on Udemy. It is taking forever!

**Thoughts:** This was really good practice for using map and splice, which I am still getting more comfortable with in JS. I'm 55% of the way through this program, which is good progress because it is like a 24 hour course and covers some really tough JS topics.
