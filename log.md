# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November, 4, 2019
##### jQuery & CSS

**Today's Progress:** Updated CSS and worked on using Open Weather API to create a weather dashboard.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more comfortable with jQuery and AJAX calls, but still figuring out the most efficient ways to utilize results from a third party API.

### Day 2: November 5, 2019
#### Going over JS Basics

**Today's Progress:** Making my way through Free Code Camp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification to supplement what I've been learning through my bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** So far I've completed 77/100 Basic JavaScript modules and 7/20 Basic Data Structures modules. Even though alot of this so far has been review, it's been helpful to have multiple iterations of lessons from my bootcamp to further build my JS knowledge base.

### Day 3: November, 6, 2019
#### 50% Done with Web Developer Bootcamp

**Today's Progress:** Today I did a code-along project that is part of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. After completing this project, I am now 50% done with this course!

**Thoughts:** Even though this was a code along, I still managed to do some independent coding by pausing the video at times  so that I could attempt my own solutions before seeing how the instructor solved different problems. Also it was a good way for me to notice little bugs that appear due to mistyping/misnaming functions etc. and still required me to do some of my own problem solving in case my code wasn't working as expected. I'm starting to feel a lot stronger with CSS as pretty much all of the CSS in this video I could do on my own without watching the instructor walkthrough.

### Day 4: November, 7, 2019
#### Bootcamp Homework Week

**Today's Progress:** For my in-person coding bootcamp, we are tasked with creating a portfolio featuring some of our work up to this point so I spent most of today working on the portfolio html and css, then started working on the other homework assignment due this week, the Weather App I worked on on Day 1. 

**Thoughts:** Weather App is already looking a lot better than it did earlier this week. Working on refactoring and cleaning up my code. There are still a few quirks to getting data from the Open Weather API that I'm still figuring out, but the assignment is nearly complete. Also, I've been really enjoying working on my portfolio and playing with the CSS.


### Day 5: November, 8, 2019
#### Completed this week's homework

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Weather Dashboard that I have been working on and feel happy that I got all of the functionality that I wanted to work.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm making a lot of progress with jQuery and JavaScript. Currently in my bootcamp we are learning node.JS and I feel way more confident writing functions to export to node than I expected. This challenge has really helped me focus on not just watching tutorials or reading how-tos, but to actually code every day and it's been so helpful.

### Day 6: November 9, 2019
#### Learning to work with Google Maps API

**Today's Progress:** My class was cancelled this weekend for Veteran's Day, so I met up with my study group and coded utilzing the Google Maps API and trying to incorporate some functionality to a website extracting event data from Google Calendar to populate the address on the map.

**Thoughts:** Definitely making progress on implementing API documentation to fit the needs of my applications.

### Day 7: November 10, 2019
#### FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress:** Today I made my way through some more of the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.

**Thoughts:** I have a tougher time coding abstract, generic functions for each unit than I do designing my own functions, but I learn a lot of little tips from completing the FreeCodeCamp activities.

### Day 8: November 11, 2019
#### Debugging Old Projects

**Today's Progress:** I decide this week to work on fixing a homework assignment I attempted when I first started my bootcamp that was completely non-functioning. Today I worked on analyzing the logic and redefining my variables, as well as switching from prompts to DOM manipulation to store user input.

**Thoughts:** It's really crazy how far I've come in my coding journey since starting my bootcamp 10 weeks ago. This assignment was from week 3 and I remember struggling so hard with it, and re-doing the project now was much less of a struggle.

### Day 9: November 12, 2019
#### Completed Assignment Redesign

**Today's Progress:** I completed the redesign of my homework assignment that I started yesterday and I'm really happy with the functionality.

**Thoughts:** I seriously cannot believe how much I have learned since Week 3 of my coding bootcamp vs now. It's like night and day. Successfully re-coding this assignment has given me so much confidence and motivation for where I'll be as a developer in another ten weeks.

### Day 10: November, 13, 2019
#### Learning Node.js & JavaScript callbacks

**Today's Progres:** The past few weeks I've been getting into node.js and applying my knowledge of JavaScript to build back-end applications. Today I just practiced different built-in methods to further familiarize myself with node. 

**Thoughts:** I'm getting more comfortable using differnet open source libraries and can't wait to learn even more and start working more on the back-end.

### Day 11: November, 14, 2019
#### Making Web Dev Bootcamp progress

**Today's Progress:** Today I did a code-along with Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp to create a to-do list using jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Like the other code-along project for this course, I tried to code on my own and then see how the instructor solved the different problems. I did a project similar to this in my own in-person bootcamp, and I felt way more comfortable doing this on my own this time around.

### Day 12: November 14, 2019
#### More JavaScript & Node.js

**Today's Progress:** I worked on more FreeCodeCamp but then it crashed for some reason. I'm almost done with the JavaScript Basics and Data Structures section. I'm also really proud that I've made it 60% through Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp! I kept working on exporting functions to Node.js and learning cloud developer environments.

**Thoughts:** The full-stack workflow is making a lot more sense to me now, and I honestly cannot wait to learn more back-end development!
