# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November, 4, 2019
##### jQuery & CSS

**Today's Progress:** Updated CSS and worked on using Open Weather API to create a weather dashboard.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more comfortable with jQuery and AJAX calls, but still figuring out the most efficient ways to utilize results from a third party API.

### Day 2: November 5, 2019
#### Going over JS Basics

**Today's Progress:** Making my way through Free Code Camp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification to supplement what I've been learning through my bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** So far I've completed 77/100 Basic JavaScript modules and 7/20 Basic Data Structures modules. Even though alot of this so far has been review, it's been helpful to have multiple iterations of lessons from my bootcamp to further build my JS knowledge base.

### Day 3: November, 6, 2019
#### 50% Done with Web Developer Bootcamp

**Today's Progress:** Today I did a code-along project that is part of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. After completing this project, I am now 50% done with this course!

**Thoughts:** Even though this was a code along, I still managed to do some independent coding by pausing the video at times  so that I could attempt my own solutions before seeing how the instructor solved different problems. Also it was a good way for me to notice little bugs that appear due to mistyping/misnaming functions etc. and still required me to do some of my own problem solving in case my code wasn't working as expected. I'm starting to feel a lot stronger with CSS as pretty much all of the CSS in this video I could do on my own without watching the instructor walkthrough.

### Day 4: November, 7, 2019
#### Bootcamp Homework Week

**Today's Progress:** For my in-person coding bootcamp, we are tasked with creating a portfolio featuring some of our work up to this point so I spent most of today working on the portfolio html and css, then started working on the other homework assignment due this week, the Weather App I worked on on Day 1. 

**Thoughts:** Weather App is already looking a lot better than it did earlier this week. Working on refactoring and cleaning up my code. There are still a few quirks to getting data from the Open Weather API that I'm still figuring out, but the assignment is nearly complete. Also, I've been really enjoying working on my portfolio and playing with the CSS.


### Day 5: November, 8, 2019
#### Completed this week's homework

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Weather Dashboard that I have been working on and feel happy that I got all of the functionality that I wanted to work.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm making a lot of progress with jQuery and JavaScript. Currently in my bootcamp we are learning node.JS and I feel way more confident writing functions to export to node than I expected. This challenge has really helped me focus on not just watching tutorials or reading how-tos, but to actually code every day and it's been so helpful.
