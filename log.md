# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November, 4, 2019
##### jQuery & CSS

**Today's Progress:** Updated CSS and worked on using Open Weather API to create a weather dashboard.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more comfortable with jQuery and AJAX calls, but still figuring out the most efficient ways to utilize results from a third party API.

### Day 2: November 5, 2019
#### Going over JS Basics

**Today's Progres:** Making my way through Free Code Camp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification to supplement what I've been learning through my bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** So far I've completed 77/100 Basic JavaScript modules and 7/20 Basic Data Structures modules. Even though alot of this so far has been review, it's been helpful to have multiple iterations of lessons from my bootcamp to further build my JS knowledge base.
